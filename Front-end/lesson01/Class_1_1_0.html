<body>**Good morning, everyone.**

  It’s my great honor to introduce the **7th Nanshan Artificial Intelligence Forum**, held on October 11, 2025, at
  Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

  This forum brought together more than **300 AI researchers**, with a focus on cutting-edge fields like
  **brain-inspired
  computing** and **multimodal models**. Under the theme *“Face-to-Face with National AI Experts,”* we were joined by
  five
  leading scholars, including **Prof. Pan Gang** and **Prof. Yan Tianyi**.

  Our objectives were clear:
  First, to **share expert knowledge** and promote the national “AI+” initiative, especially in **AI+Health** and
  **AI+Manufacturing**.
  Second, to **foster collaboration**—resulting in joint training programs with top universities and regional
  partnerships
  across Sichuan and Chongqing.
  Third, to **tackle social challenges**, such as aging and uneven medical resources, with real AI-driven solutions.

  Let me highlight a few key achievements:

  - **Prof. Pan Gang(潘纲)’s team** achieved a **91.3% accuracy** in mind-controlled robotic arm grasping, published in a
  *Nature* journal.
  - **Prof. Yan Tianyi(严天翊)**developed a non-invasive neural regulation system, improving motor function in Parkinson’s
  patients by **63%**.
  - **Prof. Wang Peng(王鹏)** optimized multimodal models to run efficiently on consumer-grade hardware.
  - **Researcher Li Zhicheng(李志诚)** reduced misdiagnosis rates in tumor typing from **23% to 9%** in pilot hospitals.
  - **Additionally, Prof. Fang Yuming(方玉明)'s work in virtual-reality integration is groundbreaking. His "RealFusion"
  system can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single sketch and his algorithms are already powering smart park
  management in Chongqing, significantly improving energy efficiency.**

  Looking ahead, we see promising trends:

  - Brain-computer interfaces and spiking neural networks are becoming more powerful and efficient.
  - Non-invasive neurotechnology is entering homes and hospitals.
  - Multimodal AI is enabling smarter, faster, and more private edge computing.
  - And virtual-real fusion is shaping the future of smart cities and the metaverse.

  In summary, this forum was not just an academic event—it was a platform for **innovation, collaboration, and
  real-world
  impact**.

  We believe that **chances live in communication**, and through events like this, we are shaping the future of AI
  together.

  Thank you all for your participation and support.
